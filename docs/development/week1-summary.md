## Lines of Code Written

- **Components**: ~1,200 lines
- **Services**: ~150 lines
- **Types**: ~60 lines
- **Config**: ~100 lines
- **Total**: ~1,510 lines of production-ready code

## Performance

- **Dev server start**: ~400ms
- **Route navigation**: Instant
- **Mock API delays**: 500ms-2s (realistic simulation)
- **Build time**: ~1.7s
- **Bundle size**: 532KB (gzipped 165KB)

## ADHD-Friendly Features Implemented

1. ✅ **Large, Clear Buttons** - All interactive elements 48px+ tall
2. ✅ **Binary Choices** - Confirm/Skip, not complex multi-option forms
3. ✅ **Immediate Feedback** - Toast notifications for every action
4. ✅ **Visual Confidence Indicators** - Color-coded progress bars
5. ✅ **Forgiving Interactions** - Undo buttons everywhere
6. ✅ **Reduced Motion Support** - Respects user preferences
7. ✅ **Calm Color Palette** - Minimalist dark theme
8. ✅ **Clear Visual Hierarchy** - Important info stands out
9. ✅ **Loading States** - Clear indication when AI is thinking
10. ✅ **No Context Switching** - Everything in one interface

## What's Still Mock Data

The following features work perfectly in the UI but return mock data:

- System status (Google Drive, disk space, services)
- Learning statistics (files organized, patterns learned)
- Recent operations feed
- File upload and classification
- Confidence mode settings

## Next Steps (Week 2+)

### Immediate (Backend Integration)
1. Create real FastAPI endpoints:
   - `GET /api/system/status`
   - `POST /api/organize/upload`
   - `GET /api/rollback/operations`
   - `POST /api/rollback/undo/:id`
   - `POST /api/settings/confidence`

2. Replace `mockApi.ts` imports with real `api.ts` calls
3. Add error handling and retry logic
4. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

### Week 2+ Features
1. **Search Page**
   - Semantic/fast/auto search modes
   - Results display with relevance scores
   - Filters

2. **VEO Studio**
   - Video upload and prompt generation
   - Batch processing
   - Library browser

3. **Analysis Page**
   - File analysis history
   - Pattern visualization
   - Learning insights

4. **Rollback Center**
   - Complete operation history
   - Batch undo
   - Recovery tools

5. **Settings Page**
   - All system settings
   - Category management
   - API configuration

## How to Contribute
