=== Bashrc Fix for Remote ===
The error:
  -bash: /home/bear/.bashrc: line 388: syntax error near unexpected token '('
  -bash: /home/bear/.bashrc: line 388: 'ai-status() {'

This usually happens in bash if:
1. There's a stray character before the '('.
2. There's a space between the name and the '()', e.g., 'ai-status () {'.
3. The function name contains illegal characters.

RECOMMENDED FIX:
Ensure the line in ~/.bashrc looks exactly like this (no spaces):
ai-status() {
    # function body
}
