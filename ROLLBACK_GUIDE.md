# 🛡️ Easy Rollback System - Complete User Guide

## 🎯 **What Is the Rollback System?**

The Easy Rollback System is your **safety net** for AI file operations. It tracks every file rename, move, or organization action so you can **instantly undo anything that goes wrong**.

### **Why This System Was Created**

After discovering that an AI system had automatically renamed files in Google Drive with random names, creating "a real mess," we built the most comprehensive rollback system available. This system provides:

- **Complete transparency** - See exactly what the AI did to your files
- **One-click undo** - Instantly reverse any operation
- **ADHD-friendly design** - Simple, visual, no confusing interfaces
- **Peace of mind** - Never fear AI file operations again

---

## 🚨 **Emergency Quick Start**

**Something went wrong with your files? Start here:**

```bash
# 1. See what happened recently
python easy_rollback_system.py --today

# 2. If you see bad operations, undo them ALL immediately
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo-today

# 3. Check that the rollback worked
python easy_rollback_system.py --today
```

**That's it!** The rollback system will undo all of today's file operations and restore your original filenames.

## 📋 **Understanding the Operation Display**

When you run `python easy_rollback_system.py --list`, you'll see operations like this:

```
📅 September 9, 2025
----------------------------------------

🔴 [123] 14:32:15
    📁 Original: 'Client_Contract_2024_Final.pdf'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'random_filename_abc123.pdf'
    📍 Location: Google Drive/Business
    🔴 Confidence: 45.2%
    💬 Notes: Auto-renamed by gdrive_librarian.py
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 123

✅ [124] 14:35:22
    📁 Original: 'messy_filename.docx'  
    ➡️  Renamed: 'Project_Proposal_2024.docx'
    📍 Location: /Users/user/Documents
    🟢 Confidence: 92.4%
    💬 Notes: ROLLBACK EXECUTED: 2025-09-09T14:40:15
```

### **Status Icons:**
- 🔴 **Active** - Can be rolled back
- ✅ **Executed** - Already rolled back
- ❌ **Failed** - Rollback attempt failed
- ⏰ **Expired** - Too old to rollback

### **Confidence Colors:**
- 🟢 **Green (90%+)** - High confidence, likely correct
- 🟡 **Yellow (75-89%)** - Medium confidence, might be wrong
- 🔴 **Red (<75%)** - Low confidence, likely wrong

**Rule of thumb:** Red operations are usually the ones you want to undo!

## 🔍 **Real Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Random File Renames**

You notice files in Google Drive have weird names like `abc123def.pdf`:

```bash
$ python easy_rollback_system.py --today

📅 September 9, 2025
----------------------------------------

🔴 [156] 10:15:33
    📁 Original: 'TV_Show_Contract_Final.pdf'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'abc123def.pdf'
    📍 Location: Google Drive/Entertainment
    🔴 Confidence: 23.1%
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 156

🔴 [157] 10:16:12  
    📁 Original: 'Demo_Reel_2024.mp4'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'xyz789ghi.mp4'
    📍 Location: Google Drive/Creative
    🔴 Confidence: 18.7%
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 157
```

**Solution:** Low confidence + weird names = undo everything!
```bash
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo-today
```

### **Example 2: Good Operations Mixed with Bad**

Some operations look good, others don't:

```bash
$ python easy_rollback_system.py --list

🟢 [201] 09:30:15
    📁 Original: 'IMG_1234.png'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'Contract_Scan_Sept2025.png'
    📍 Location: /Users/user/Documents
    🟢 Confidence: 94.2%
    ✅ Already rolled back

🔴 [202] 09:32:44
    📁 Original: 'Important_Meeting_Notes.docx'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'random_text_file.docx'  
    📍 Location: /Users/user/Documents  
    🔴 Confidence: 31.5%
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 202
```

**Solution:** Keep the good one, undo the bad one:
```bash
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 202
```

### **Example 3: Finding Specific Files**

You can't find a contract that got renamed:

```bash
$ python easy_rollback_system.py --search "contract"

🔍 Search results for 'contract':
=================================

🔴 [145] 08:22:17
    📁 Original: 'Client_Management_Contract.pdf'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'business_document_final.pdf'
    📍 Location: Google Drive/Business
    🔴 Confidence: 67.3%
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 145
```

**Solution:** Found it! Undo the rename:
```bash
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 145
```

## 💡 **ADHD-Friendly Design Features**

### **Simple Visual Layout**
- Clear before/after file names
- Color-coded confidence levels  
- One command per action
- No complex menus or options

### **Predictable Commands**
- `--list` always shows operations
- `--undo` always reverses operations
- `--search` always finds operations
- Commands work the same way every time

### **Safety Features**
- Shows exactly what will be undone before doing it
- Confirms success or failure immediately
- Can't accidentally undo twice (operations are marked as executed)
- Emergency `--undo-today` for when everything went wrong

### **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Operations grouped by date for easy navigation
- Most recent operations shown first
- Low-confidence operations clearly marked with red icons
- Simple yes/no: "Does this look right? If not, undo it."

---

## 🎯 **How the System Works Internally**

### **What Gets Tracked**
Every file operation creates a record with:
- Original filename and location
- New filename and location  
- Timestamp of the operation
- Confidence level (how sure the AI was)
- Google Drive file ID (if applicable)
- Notes about what system made the change

### **What Can Be Rolled Back**
- **File renames** - Changes filename back to original
- **File moves** - Moves file back to original location
- **Google Drive operations** - Reverts names in cloud storage
- **Local file operations** - Reverts names on your computer

### **What Cannot Be Rolled Back**
- File deletions (files are never actually deleted by the organizer)
- Operations older than 90 days (database cleanup)
- Files that no longer exist (were manually deleted)

---

## ⚠️ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **"Operation not found" Error**
```bash
❌ Operation 123 not found
```
**Solution:** The operation ID might be wrong. Run `--list` to see current IDs.

### **"File not found" Error**  
```bash
❌ Could not find file 'renamed_file.pdf' to rollback
```
**Solution:** The file might have been moved again or deleted. Check the location shown in the operation details.

### **"Already rolled back" Message**
```bash
❌ Operation 123 already rolled back
```
**Solution:** This operation was already undone. No action needed.

### **Google Drive Authentication Issues**
```bash
❌ Google Drive authentication failed
```
**Solution:** Re-run the Google Drive authentication:
```bash
python gdrive_cli.py auth --credentials gdrive_credentials.json
```

---

## 🔧 **Advanced Usage**

### **Database Location**
The rollback database is stored at:
```
/Users/user/Github/ai-file-organizer/file_rollback.db
```

### **Manual Database Inspection** 
```bash
# View database contents (for technical users)
sqlite3 file_rollback.db "SELECT * FROM file_rollback ORDER BY operation_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### **Backup Your Rollback Data**
```bash
# Copy the database to backup location
cp file_rollback.db file_rollback_backup.db
```

```

### **Still Need Help?**
1. Check the main README.md for system requirements
2. Verify Google Drive authentication if cloud operations failed
3. Make sure file_rollback.db exists in the project directory
4. Contact support with the exact error message and operation details

---

## 🔒 **Privacy and Security**

### **Local Processing**
- All rollback data stored locally on your computer
- No cloud uploads of rollback information
- Google Drive operations only change filenames, not content

### **Data Retention**
- Operations stored for 90 days automatically
- Database cleaned up to prevent unlimited growth
- You can manually backup rollback data if needed

### **File Safety**
- **Files are never deleted** by the rollback system
- Only filenames and locations are changed
- Original file content remains untouched
- Can't accidentally overwrite different files

---

**Remember: The rollback system exists to give you confidence in AI file operations. Use it whenever something looks wrong, and never hesitate to undo operations that don't make sense!**
