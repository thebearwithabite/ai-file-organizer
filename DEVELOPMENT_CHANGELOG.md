## üö® **CRITICAL INCIDENTS**

### **2025-09-08: Missing System Investigation**

**INCIDENT**: `gdrive_librarian.py` source code mysteriously missing despite evidence of recent activity.

**Evidence Found**:
- ‚úÖ Compiled file exists: `__pycache__/gdrive_librarian.cpython-312.pyc`
- ‚úÖ File operation logs exist: `file_rollback.db` shows 2 operations on 2025-09-01
- ‚úÖ Google Drive files tagged with "Uploaded by AI Librarian | Confidence: 70.0%"
- ‚ùå Source code missing - no record of removal
- ‚ùå No change log entry
- ‚ùå No communication to user

**Files Affected by Missing System**:
1. `grok doc.pdf` ‚Üí `TPTD - Episode Draft - 2025-09-01.pdf` (ROLLBACK EXECUTED)
2. `Mastering_the_game_of_Go_with_deep_neural_networks.pdf` ‚Üí `AlphaGo - Research Paper - DeepMind.pdf` (ACTIVE)

**Impact**: 
- User discovered randomly renamed files in Google Drive
- No way to understand or fix the naming logic
- Loss of trust in automated systems
- ADHD-unfriendly unpredictable behavior

**Resolution Status**: üî¥ UNDER INVESTIGATION

**Lessons Learned**:
- ‚ùå No system should be removed without documentation
- ‚ùå Need mandatory change log for all code changes
- ‚ùå Need user notification for system modifications
- ‚ùå Need better rollback mechanisms
