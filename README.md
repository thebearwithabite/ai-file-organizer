### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/thebearwithabite/ai-file-organizer.git
cd ai-file-organizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenAI API key (for classification only - no files sent to API)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### First Run - Emergency Storage Recovery (if needed)
```bash
# Check storage space
df -h

# Emergency cleanup if critically low on space
python system_storage_cleanup.py --execute --docker-only  # Frees ~16GB

# Move ghost directories to staging for later organization
# (Check for any CONTENT_LIBRARY_MASTER or similar directories)
```

### Core File Organization
```bash
# Start with safe file recycling (ADHD-friendly - can undo for 7 days)
python interactive_organizer.py organize --dry-run  # Preview first
python interactive_organizer.py organize --live     # Actually organize

# Index your existing files for semantic search
python vector_librarian.py

# Try semantic search
python enhanced_librarian.py search "important contracts" --mode semantic

# Check safe recycling status
python safe_file_recycling.py --status
```

### Duplicate Detection & Storage Optimization

## 🧠 Revolutionary Features Deep Dive

### **🛡️ Safe File Recycling System (Zero "Oops!" Moments)**
Every file move goes through a safe recycling system first - eliminating anxiety about permanent mistakes.

```bash
♻️  File Recycling Process:
   1. File moved to temporary recycling directory
   2. Full audit trail maintained in SQLite database
   3. 7-day undo window for all operations
   4. Simple restore commands: python safe_file_recycling.py --restore filename
   5. Automatic cleanup after retention period

📊 Recycling Status:
   Files in recycling: 23
   Total space: 156.7 MB
   Oldest file: 3 days ago
   Can restore: All files
```

### **🗑️ Bulletproof Duplicate Detection**
Two-tier hashing system catches duplicates with 100% safety and actually deletes them.

```bash
🔍 Duplicate Detection Process:
   1. Quick MD5 hash for real-time detection
   2. Secure SHA-256 hash for safe deletion
   3. Smart pattern recognition ("filename (1).ext", "filename copy.ext")
   4. Safety scoring based on file age, location, patterns
   5. Automatic deletion of confirmed duplicates

📊 Recent Scan Results:
   Files scanned: 1,247
   Duplicates found: 77
   Space freed: 269.6 MB
   Safety score: 100% (all safe to delete)
```

### **⚡ Emergency Storage Recovery**
Critical storage space management when your drive is nearly full.

```bash
🚨 Storage Crisis Management:
   Docker cleanup: 16.2 GB freed
   Cache cleanup: 2.3 GB freed  
   Ghost directories: 6.7 GB moved to staging
   Duplicate removal: 269.6 MB freed
   Total recovered: 25.5 GB
```

### **🤔 Interactive Classification with 85% Confidence Rule**
- Shows you file content before asking questions
- Only asks when genuinely uncertain (< 85% confidence) 
- Learns your preferences to reduce future questions
- ADHD-friendly: Clear choices, no overwhelming options

```bash
📄 Analyzing: client_agreement.pdf
🔍 Content Preview:
   "This agreement between Company and Client Name covers 
    exclusive representation for television and film..."

🤖 Initial AI Analysis:
   Suggested Category: Entertainment Industry (72% confidence)
   
❓ CLASSIFICATION QUESTION
   Based on the content above:
   Should this entertainment document be filed under:
   1. Current active projects
   2. Business operations 
   3. Archived contracts

✅ You chose: Current active projects
   Confidence updated: 95% ✅
   ♻️  File recycled safely (can undo for 7 days)
```

### **🏷️ Smart File Naming Protocol**
Automatically generates meaningful filenames using the format:
`YYYY-MM-DD_PROJECT_CLIENT_CONTENT-TYPE_vN.ext`

**Examples:**
- `client_stuff.pdf` → `2025-08-21_ENT_ClientName_Management-Agreement_v1.pdf`
- `commission_report.xlsx` → `2025-08-21_BUS_Internal_Commission-Report_v1.xlsx`

### **🧠 Vector Database with Smart Chunking**
- **Contracts**: Chunked by sections (compensation, terms, exclusivity)
- **Scripts**: Chunked by scenes and dialogue  
- **Emails**: Separate headers from body content
- **Business docs**: Organized by topics and sections

### **🔄 Background Monitoring with Real-Time Duplicate Detection**
```bash
📁 Directory Monitoring:
   ✅ Staging: Processes immediately (organized files)
   ✅ Downloads: 7-day wait (won't disrupt active work)  
   ✅ Desktop: 7-day wait (ADHD-friendly)
   ✅ Documents: Processes regularly
   ✅ Email: Auto-indexes new messages
   ✅ Duplicates: Caught and removed in real-time
```

    r'Generated Image.*\.jpeg',   # ChatGPT generated images
    r'.*_\d{8}_\d{6}\..*'        # Timestamped duplicates
]
```

**Database Schema:**
```sql
file_hashes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
