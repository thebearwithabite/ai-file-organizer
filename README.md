## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 1. Install & Start

**Recommended: Use Virtual Environment**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thebearwithabite/ai-file-organizer
cd ai-file-organizer

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

## 🛡️ **Easy Rollback System - Your Safety Net**

**CRITICAL FEATURE:** Never fear AI file operations again. One-click undo for any operation that went wrong.

```bash
# See what the AI did recently
python easy_rollback_system.py --list

# Undo a specific operation
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 123

# Emergency: Undo ALL today's operations
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo-today
```

**Visual Protection:**
```
🔴 [123] 14:32:15
    📁 Original: 'Client_Contract_2024_Final.pdf'
    ➡️  Renamed: 'random_filename_abc123.pdf'  ← OOPS!
    🔴 Confidence: 45.2% (Low confidence = likely wrong)
    🔧 Rollback: python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 123
```
