📚 **Learning System** - Remembers your decisions and improves over time  
⚡ **ADHD-Friendly** - Reduces cognitive load with smart defaults  
🔄 **Auto-Updates** - Vector database stays current automatically  
📧 **Email Integration** - Searches across documents AND emails  
🏷️ **Smart Naming** - Generates meaningful filenames automatically

## 🎯 Perfect For

### **Professionals with ADHD**
*"Finally, a system that works WITH my brain, not against it. No more decision paralysis - just ask and find."*

### **Creative Professionals** 
*"Finds contracts, scripts, and emails instantly. The semantic search understands 'find payment terms' without exact keywords."*

### **Knowledge Workers**
*"Organizes thousands of documents automatically. After a few corrections, it knows exactly how I like things filed."*

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-file-organizer.git
cd ai-file-organizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenAI API key (for classification only - no files sent to API)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### 2. First Run - Interactive Organization
```bash
# See what questions the system would ask
python show_questions.py

# Organize files with smart questions and previews
python integrated_organizer.py

# Start background monitoring (keeps everything up to date)
python monitor_control.py start
```

### 3. Search Everything
```bash
# Semantic search across all your content
python enhanced_librarian.py search "contract exclusivity terms"
python enhanced_librarian.py search "creative project emails from last month" 
python enhanced_librarian.py search "financial documents about commissions"
```

## 🎬 How It Works

### **Before AI Organizer:**
```
Downloads/
├── contract_final_v2.pdf
├── IMPORTANT_DOC.docx  
├── email_export.txt
└── random_notes.md
```

### **After AI Organizer:**
```
01_ACTIVE_PROJECTS/
├── Entertainment_Industry/
│   └── Current_Contracts/
│       └── 2025-08-21_ENT_ClientName_Management-Agreement_v2.pdf
├── Business_Operations/
│   └── Financial_Records/
│       └── 2025-08-21_BUS_General_Commission-Report_v1.docx
└── Creative_Production/
    └── 2025-08-21_CRE_General_Notes_v1.md

04_METADATA_SYSTEM/
└── comprehensive_index.xlsx  # Searchable database of everything
```

**Plus:** Semantic search finds things like *"payment terms"* even when the document says *"compensation structure"*!

## 🧠 Key Features Deep Dive

### **Interactive Classification with 85% Confidence Rule**
- Shows you file content before asking questions
- Only asks when genuinely uncertain (< 85% confidence) 
- Learns your preferences to reduce future questions
- ADHD-friendly: Clear choices, no overwhelming options

```bash
📄 Analyzing: client_agreement.pdf
🔍 Content Preview:
   "This agreement between Company and Client Name covers 
    exclusive representation for television and film..."

🤖 Initial AI Analysis:
   Suggested Category: Entertainment Industry (72% confidence)
   
❓ CLASSIFICATION QUESTION
   Based on the content above:
   Should this entertainment document be filed under:
   1. Current active projects
   2. Business operations 
   3. Archived contracts

✅ You chose: Current active projects
   Confidence updated: 95% ✅
```

### **Smart File Naming Protocol**
Automatically generates meaningful filenames using the format:
`YYYY-MM-DD_PROJECT_CLIENT_CONTENT-TYPE_vN.ext`

**Examples:**
- `client_stuff.pdf` → `2025-08-21_ENT_ClientName_Management-Agreement_v1.pdf`
- `commission_report.xlsx` → `2025-08-21_BUS_Internal_Commission-Report_v1.xlsx`

### **Vector Database with Smart Chunking**
- **Contracts**: Chunked by sections (compensation, terms, exclusivity)
- **Scripts**: Chunked by scenes and dialogue  
- **Emails**: Separate headers from body content
- **Business docs**: Organized by topics and sections

### **Background Monitoring with ADHD-Friendly 7-Day Rule**
```bash
📁 Directory Monitoring:
   ✅ Staging: Processes immediately (organized files)
   ✅ Downloads: 7-day wait (won't disrupt active work)  
   ✅ Desktop: 7-day wait (ADHD-friendly)
   ✅ Documents: Processes regularly
   ✅ Email: Auto-indexes new messages
```
