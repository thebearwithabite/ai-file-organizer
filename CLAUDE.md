### 🚨 **MANDATORY PROCESS: Check Critical Files First**
**BEFORE starting ANY task, read these files for context and process requirements:**

1. **`MANDATORY_WORKFLOW_CHECKLIST.md`** - Process requirements for all work
2. **`PM_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS_MEMO.md`** - Current project priorities and status  
3. **`CRITICAL_PROCESS_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`** - Quick navigation and templates

### 🤖 **MANDATORY: Agent Usage Requirements**
**AFTER checking critical files, use this agent checklist:**

```bash
# Agent Selection Checklist (ALWAYS use before starting work):
# □ Multi-step task (>3 steps)? → task-orchestrator
# □ Code implementation/verification? → testing-debugging-expert  
# □ Documentation work? → documentation-expert
# □ UI/UX improvements? → ux-fullstack-designer
# □ Google Drive operations? → google-drive-api-expert
# □ Complex research/search? → general-purpose

# Examples of MANDATORY agent use:
python -c "# Multi-step implementation" # → Use task-orchestrator
python -c "# After any code changes" # → Use testing-debugging-expert
python -c "# Any documentation updates" # → Use documentation-expert
python -c "# Any web interface work" # → Use ux-fullstack-designer
python -c "# Any Google Drive issues" # → Use google-drive-api-expert
```

### 📋 **Workflow Automation**
Use templates from `TODO_TEMPLATES_AGENT_INTEGRATION.py` for automatic agent integration in TodoWrite.

### Development Tips
- **Agent-First Workflow** - Use specialized agents rather than manual work
- **No formal linting setup** - maintain clean Python code style
- **No package manager** - use pip with requirements files
- **FastAPI server** - Main entry point is `main.py`
- **Test files** - Individual test scripts, no test framework
- **Audio Analysis** - Uses librosa, mutagen, OpenAI for spectral analysis
- **Adaptive Learning** - Pickle files store classification patterns and user corrections

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### Quick Search (GUI):
1. Double-click "Enhanced AI Search.app" 
2. Type natural language: "Client Name contracts"
3. Choose search mode: Fast/Semantic/Auto
4. Get results with context and reasoning

### Command Line Search (Hybrid Cloud + Local):
```bash
# Unified search across Google Drive + local files
python enhanced_librarian.py search "AI consciousness papers" --mode semantic
python enhanced_librarian.py search "payment terms" --mode fast  
python enhanced_librarian.py search "meeting schedules" --mode auto

# Google Drive specific commands
python gdrive_integration.py  # Check Google Drive status and create directory structure
```

### Interactive File Organization:
```bash
# Organize files with smart questions (ADHD-friendly)
python interactive_organizer.py organize --live     # Actually move files
python interactive_organizer.py organize --dry-run  # Preview only

# Quick organize specific folder
python interactive_organizer.py quick /Users/user/Downloads --live

# Test single file
python interactive_organizer.py file "/path/to/document.pdf" --live
```

### Index New Content (Hybrid Architecture):
```bash
# Index from Google Drive primary storage
python enhanced_librarian.py index --folder "/Users/user/GoogleDrive/AI_Organizer/01_ACTIVE_PROJECTS"
python vector_librarian.py  # Index emails + documents with smart chunking across cloud and local

# Check Google Drive integration status
python gdrive_integration.py  # Shows Google Drive mount status and creates directory structure
```

### Easy Rollback System (CRITICAL - ALWAYS USE WHEN FILE OPERATIONS GO WRONG):
```bash
# FIRST: Always check what AI operations happened recently
python easy_rollback_system.py --list

# If you see mysterious/wrong file operations, undo them immediately:
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo 123      # Undo specific operation ID
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo-today    # Emergency: undo all today's operations

# Search for specific file operations that went wrong:
python easy_rollback_system.py --search "contract"  # Find operations on files containing "contract"

# Show today's operations only (helpful for debugging):
python easy_rollback_system.py --today
```

## 💡 **Real Examples**

### Typical Searches User Makes:
- `"TV Show contract exclusivity"`
- `"Creative Project episode about attention mechanisms"`
- `"emails about creative collaboration"`
- `"commission payments from last quarter"`
- `"SAG-AFTRA agreement terms"`

### What Makes This Different:
- **Understands context**: Knows "Finn" means Client Name
- **Connects ideas**: Links creative projects to business documents
- **Learns patterns**: Recognizes User's work style and priorities
- **Reduces friction**: No manual tagging or complex folder structures

## 🏛️ **High-Level Architecture**

### Core System Flow
1. **File Ingestion** → Files enter through Downloads/Desktop monitoring or manual input
2. **Content Extraction** → `content_extractor.py` processes PDFs, DOCX, emails
3. **Semantic Analysis** → `vector_librarian.py` creates embeddings with ChromaDB
4. **Classification** → `interactive_classifier.py` determines categories with confidence scores
5. **User Interaction** → Low-confidence files trigger questions via web UI or CLI
6. **Organization** → `interactive_organizer.py` moves files to appropriate locations
7. **Rollback Safety** → `easy_rollback_system.py` logs all operations for undo

### Key Design Patterns
- **Hybrid Storage**: Google Drive as primary with local caching/streaming
- **Confidence-Based Actions**: 85% threshold for automatic filing

```

### Universal Interactive Batch Processing
```python
# SYSTEM-WIDE interactive processing for ALL file types
organizer.interactive_batch_process(
    file_list,  # Can be PDFs, emails, audio, images, any file type
    confidence_threshold=0.7,  # Ask when uncertain about ANY file
    preview_content=True,      # Preview PDFs, play audio, show images
    dry_run=True              # Test mode for all file types
)

# Universal interaction modes for ALL file types:
# SMART (70%) - Ask about uncertain contracts, emails, audio, etc.
# MINIMAL (40%) - Only ask about very uncertain files of any type
# ALWAYS (100%) - Human review for every file (contracts, creative, etc.)
# NEVER (0%) - Fully automatic for all file types

# Examples of system-wide learning:
- "Client contract" patterns learned and applied to new contracts
- "Creative project" email patterns applied to similar communications  
- "Podcast episode" file patterns for creative content organization
- "Business document" classification improving over time
```

```python
# Filename pattern analysis for content hints
descriptors = {
    'ambient': ['ambient', 'atmosphere', 'background'],
    'percussion': ['drum', 'beat', 'rhythm', 'kick'],
    'vocal': ['vocal', 'voice', 'speech', 'dialogue'], 
    'nature': ['nature', 'wind', 'rain', 'forest'],
    'mechanical': ['robot', 'machine', 'tech', 'digital'],
    'emotional': ['sad', 'happy', 'dark', 'calm', 'tense']
}
```

## 🚨 **Implementation Priority for SYSTEM-WIDE Features**

6. **Universal Filename Enhancement**: 
   - Semantic preservation + metadata integration for ALL file types
   - Client-aware naming (entertainment industry context)

**The goal: The system learns from your corrections on a contract and applies that knowledge to emails, creative files, and audio - creating a truly intelligent, unified file management system.**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Hybrid Cloud Architecture:
- **Primary Storage**: Google Drive (2TB) serves as the main storage root
- **Local Caching**: Intelligent file streaming with local metadata store
- **Background Sync**: Continuous synchronization between local and cloud
- **Emergency Staging**: 99_STAGING_EMERGENCY folder for space management
- **Unified Search**: Single search interface across local files and Google Drive

### File Types Supported:
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, Pages, TXT, MD
- **Emails**: macOS Mail (.emlx files)
- **Code**: Python, JavaScript, Jupyter notebooks
- **Creative**: Scripts, research papers, audio specs
- **Cloud Files**: Full Google Drive integration with on-demand streaming

### Smart Chunking System:
- **Contracts**: Chunks by sections (compensation, terms, exclusivity)
- **Scripts**: Chunks by scenes and dialogue
- **Emails**: Separates headers from body content
- **Research**: Preserves academic paper structure
- **Cloud Content**: Maintains smart chunking across local and cloud files

### Search Modes:
- **Fast**: Keyword matching (good for names, dates)
- **Semantic**: AI understanding (good for concepts, themes)
- **Auto**: Intelligently chooses best approach
- **Hybrid**: Combines both local and cloud sources for comprehensive results

## 🎯 **ADHD-Specific Design Decisions**

1. **Interactive questioning**: Asks clarifying questions instead of guessing
2. **85% confidence threshold**: Won't file until genuinely confident
3. **Learning system**: Remembers your decisions to reduce future questions
4. **Binary choices**: Simple "A or B" questions, not overwhelming options
5. **Immediate feedback**: Search results show instantly
6. **Forgiving search**: Works even with imprecise queries
7. **Visual context**: Shows file types, dates, relevance scores
8. **No manual organization**: System learns from content, not folders
9. **Native integration**: Feels like part of macOS, not separate app

### Example Interactive Questions:
- *"This looks like a contract for Client Name. Should I file it under Entertainment Industry or Business Operations?"*
- *"I found mentions of creative project and business terms. Is this more about the creative work or the business side?"*
- *"This document mentions multiple people. Who is it primarily about?"*

## 📝 **Development Notes**

### When Adding Features:
- Prioritize reducing cognitive load over adding complexity
- Test with User's actual files and workflows
- Maintain the "conversation with a librarian" feel
- Keep the Apple Script GUI simple and fast

### Key Principles:
- **Content over structure**: Organize by what files contain, not where they are
- **Semantic over syntactic**: Understand meaning, not just keywords  
- **Intuitive over precise**: Better to find something close than nothing at all
- **Unified over fragmented**: One search across all content types

## 🚨 **Important Context for AI Assistants**

When working on this system:

1. **User has ADHD** - organization systems must be low-friction and intuitive
2. **Entertainment industry focus** - understand contracts, talent management, creative projects
3. **Hybrid architecture** - primary storage is now Google Drive, test with actual documents from cloud and local sources
4. **macOS integration essential** - must work seamlessly within existing workflow
5. **Privacy conscious** - all processing happens locally, Google Drive is only for storage and file operations

## 🛡️ **CRITICAL: Rollback System for Trust and Safety**

**MANDATORY PRACTICE**: After any file organization operations, ALWAYS check the rollback system to ensure nothing went wrong:

```bash
# After running any organizer commands, ALWAYS run this:
python easy_rollback_system.py --today    # Check today's operations

# If operations look wrong (low confidence, bad filenames, etc.), undo immediately:
python easy_rollback_system.py --undo-today    # Emergency rollback all today's operations
```

**Why This Matters:**
- The user discovered AI systems had been renaming files with random names, creating "a real mess"
- This violated ADHD-friendly design and broke user trust
- The rollback system provides the "easy to find and navigate way of simply undoing mis-files" that was desperately needed
- NEVER perform file operations without ensuring the user can easily undo them

**Trust Recovery Protocol:**
1. Any file operation creates rollback entries automatically
2. User can see exactly what changed with before/after names
3. One-click undo for any operation that went wrong
4. Works with both local files and Google Drive operations
5. ADHD-friendly design with visual interfaces and simple commands

This isn't just a file organizer - it's an accessibility tool that makes information management possible for someone with ADHD working in a complex, document-heavy industry.
